        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello! My name is Alston Tran. I was born and raised in San Francisco, California. <br><br>
        I am currently a fourth-year majoring in Political Science at the University of California, Riverside. <br><br>
        I originally majored in psychology. However, after the 2016 presidential election, it was clear that politics within the United States was changing, norms between politicians were breaking, and interesting results were yet to be seen. Ever since then, I have focused most of my studies on American politics, learning the history and patterns within American politics that would show up throughout time. Personally, I have attended community meetings, several City Hall meetings, and many political rallies local to my hometown of San Francisco. In addition, I have volunteered at a voting center, hoping to get a glimpse of active participation in politics. <br><br> 
        Other volunteer work outside of my major would include volunteering at the Alzheimerâ€™s unit, the diabetes center, and the transport team at the California Pacific Medical Center. These hospital work initially gave me more insight towards the real workspace outside of school, along with connection with other people, learning more about the professional life of medical workers. Although my school focus has shifted from the medical aspect, I still find the work there important and interesting, nonetheless. <br><br>
        In high school, I was part of the school's robotics team, the Cardinalbotics 4159. There I was given two leadership positions as the quartermaster and the shop master. I would teach and train present and future team members on using all the machineries available in the shop. In addition, I would organize necessities for the team in completing the robot build for yearly competitions. Such experience expanded my skills in teamwork and leadership.<br><br>
